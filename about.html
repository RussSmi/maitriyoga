                        <p>I started doing yoga to try to relax when I was struggling at university. I got more than I bargained for- in a good way! Yoga gave me space to breathe and to show myself the love that I desperately needed.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="story-section highlight">
                        <p><strong>Maitri means loving kindness</strong> and that is what I want to share in my yoga classes. For me, yoga is not about trying to force your body into an impressive looking shape. Yoga is for everybody, and for every-body. I focus on enjoying movement and breathing with a sense of kindness and compassion. I want to help you connect your body and mind so that you can care for yourself as a whole person. <em>No pretzels or headstands required!</em></p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="story-section">
                        <p>I came to yoga when I was in my 20s and struggling at medical school, I didn't really know what it was or how to do it, but I instantly felt at home. Yoga allowed me the space to be myself and to accept myself in this moment. I still have insecurities and a racing mind that I think most of us share but by being in my body and slowing down I can help to ease up on myself.</p>

                        <p>In my work as a doctor, I have always been fascinated by how the mind and the body affect each other. Yoga is one way to nourish both of these aspects of ourself and promote overall wellbeing.</p>
